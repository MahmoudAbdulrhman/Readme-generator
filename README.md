# ReadMe Generator

For those seeking for an editable standard ReadMe template, this generator is for you.
Just provide a series of information and you are good to go!

## Installation

In order to get to the generator questionnaire, you must first download the repository 'readme-generator' by clicking the GitHub link under the Questions section.

Once the repository is cloned, use your terminal to initiate the command 'npm install' in order to make the app run then enter the command 'node index.js.'  A series of questions will be presented to you.  After completing the questionnaire,
a message that says 'File created!; will show up as a confirmation that the readme file has been created.  The generated README.MD will be located in the distribution folder (dist).
Open your new README.MD, click the top-right 'Open to Preview' button and voila!
